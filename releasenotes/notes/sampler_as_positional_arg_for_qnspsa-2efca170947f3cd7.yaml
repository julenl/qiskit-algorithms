  - |
    The list of arguments for `QNSPSA.get_fidelity()` has been updated to
    include only the `ansatz` and the `sampler`, and removing previous
    wildcard option. From now on, the sampler option must be explicitly
    especified, as a positional or keyword argument, and it cannot be `None`.
